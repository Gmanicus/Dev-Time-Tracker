# Dev-Time-Tracker
A time tracker &amp; grapher for us devs. It automatically logs the time we spend deving, and encourages us to stop watching Markiplier boop VR Freddy noses by drawing handy graphs of our unproductivity :D

I went to Windows Scheduler and had it run this with a 60s delay after any logon. Works perfectly!

Here's my actual productivity graphs from the past few months:
