# Dev-Time-Tracker
A time tracker &amp; grapher for us devs. It automatically logs the time we spend deving, and encourages us to stop watching Markiplier boop VR Freddy noses by drawing handy graphs of our unproductivity :D

The seconds for each day of every month and year are also saved in the "this_graph.txt" file that gets created when it is run.

I went to Windows Scheduler and had it run this with a 60s delay after any logon. Works splendidly!

Here's my actual productivity graphs from the past few months (This was finished in mid-April):
